## **Atomic Neural Network**
A curated set of  tutorials designed for working with Atomic Neural Networks

An Atomic Neural Network (ANN) is a deep learning model that predicts molecular properties by summing atom-wise contributions, each computed from the atomâ€™s local chemical environment. These environments are encoded using invariant descriptors and processed through neural networks specific to each atom type. ANNs like ANI-2x and ANI2xt are trained on quantum mechanical data and provide near-DFT accuracy for energy and force predictions while being computationally efficient, making them ideal for geometry optimization, conformer ranking, and tautomer stability analysis
